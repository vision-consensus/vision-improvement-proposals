## Simple Summary

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens.

## Abstract

This VIP is compatible with [EIP-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md)

We note that NFTs standard is widely used in different fields of blockchain.

- Some Layer2 solutions, such as Plasma, attempt to use NFT data structure to solve the data safety issue.
- DApps like Cryptokitties make us realize the great economic value of NFT.
- NFT also plays a key role in projects like vBTC, to prove the ownership of staking.

NFT tokens are added more value by those different applications. And more and more DeFi projects try to integrate with NFTs to enhance their ecso-system. We believe that standardized NFTs will open an infinitely imaginary space on Tron as well.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows applications to track and transfer NFTs on Tron. Simple VRC-721 smart contracts list as below to track a large number of NFTs. VRC-20 token standard is insufficient for handling NFTs due to each token in VRC-721 being unique. The standard of VRC-721 is inspiring on Vision. It plays an important role as well as VRC-20.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every VRC-721 compliant contract must implement the `VRC721` and `VRC165` interfaces** (subject to "caveats" below):

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

interface VRC721TokenReceiver {
    /// @notice Handle the receipt of an NFT
    /// @dev The VRC721 smart contract calls this function on the recipient

    ///  unless throwing
    function onVRC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);
}
```
**Note:The hash of `bytes4(keccak256("onVRC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)))` is different from the Ethereum version `bytes4(keccak256("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)))`. Please use `0x47f3171e` instead of `0x150b7a02`.**

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for VRC-721 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your NFTs represent.

```solidity
/// @title VRC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
///  Note: the VRC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x5b5e139f.
interface VRC721Metadata /* is VRC721 */ {
    /// @notice A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract
    function name() external view returns (string _name);

    /// @notice An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract
    function symbol() external view returns (string _symbol);

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
    /// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "VRC721
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
}
```

This is the "VRC721 Metadata JSON Schema" referenced above.

```json
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        }
    }
}
```

The **enumeration extension** is OPTIONAL for VRC-721 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your contract to publish its full list of NFTs and make them discoverable.

```solidity
/// @title VRC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional enumeration extension
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
///  Note: the VRC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x780e9d63.
interface VRC721Enumerable /* is VRC721 */ {
    /// @notice Count NFTs tracked by this contract
    /// @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of
    ///  them has an assigned and queryable owner not equal to the zero address
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Enumerate valid NFTs
    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `totalSupply()`.
    /// @param _index A counter less than `totalSupply()`
    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT,
    ///  (sort order not specified)
    function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner
    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `balanceOf(_owner)` or if
    ///  `_owner` is the zero address, representing invalid NFTs.
    /// @param _owner An address where we are interested in NFTs owned by them
    /// @param _index A counter less than `balanceOf(_owner)`
    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT assigned to `_owner`,
    ///   (sort order not specified)
    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Caveats

The 0.4.20 Solidity interface grammar is not expressive enough to document the VRC-721 standard. A contract which complies with VRC-721 MUST also abide by the following:

- Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: `payable`, implicit nonpayable, `view`, and `pure`. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a `payable` function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayble (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements `VRC721Metadata` or `VRC721Enumerable` SHALL also implement `VRC721`. VRC-721 implements the requirements of interface VRC-165.
- Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as `external` then a contract will be compliant if it uses `public` visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to `public` before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of `this.*.selector` is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.

*If a newer version of Solidity allows the caveats to be expressed in code, then this VIP MAY be updated and the caveats removed, such will be equivalent to the original specification.*Rationale

**NFT Identifiers**

Every NFT is identified by a unique `uint256` ID inside the VRC-721 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair `(contract address, uint256 tokenId)` will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. While some VRC-721 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a "black box". Also note that a NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumerations functions for a supported enumeration interface.

The choice of `uint256` allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to `uint256`.

### Transfer Mechanism

VRC-721 standardizes a safe transfer function `safeTransferFrom` (overloaded with and without a `bytes` parameter) and an unsafe function `transferFrom`. Transfers may be initiated by:

- The owner of an NFT
- The approved address of an NFT
- An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT

Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a *large* number of NFTs.

**VRC-165 Interface**

We chose Standard Interface Detection (VRC-165) to expose the interfaces that a VRC-721 smart contract supports.

A future VIP may create a global registry of interfaces for contracts. We strongly support such an VIP and it would allow your VRC-721 implementation to implement `VRC721Enumerable`, `VRC721Metadata`, or other interfaces by delegating to a separate contract.

**Privacy**

Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which NFTs an owner owns.

It may be interesting to consider a use case where NFTs are not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry. However, privacy cannot be attained because an attacker can simply (!) call `ownerOf` for every possible `tokenId`.

**Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)

We have required `name` and `symbol` functions in the metadata extension.

We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to `name` and `symbol` if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. We also remind everyone that any smart contract can use the same name and symbol as *your* contract. How a client may determine which VRC-721 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.

A mechanism is provided to associate NFTs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each NFT. The image size recommendation is taken from Instagram, they probably know much about image usability. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an NFT representing ownership of a house, in this case metadata about the house (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.

Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from `web3`, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.

*Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough)*

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `name` and `symbol` semantics from the VRC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with VRC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all VRC-721 implementations to support the `decimals` function.

Note: "Limited edition, collectible tokens" like Curio Cards and Rare Pepe are *not* distinguishable assets. They're actually a collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply (which may be `1` in extreme cases).

The `onVRC721Received` function specifically works around old deployed contracts which may inadvertently return 1 (`true`) in certain circumstances even if they don't implement a function (see Solidity DelegateCallReturnValue bug). By returning and checking for a magic value, we are able to distinguish actual affirmative responses versus these vacuous `true`s.
