## To Submit a VIP

Before you submit a VIP, you need to create an issue for comment and add the issue URL to your VIP header.   

1.&nbsp;Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.  

2.&nbsp;Add your VIP to your fork of the repository. There is a [VIP template](https://github.com/tronprotocol/VIPs/blob/master/template.md) here.  

3.&nbsp;Submit a Pull Request to Vision's VIPs repository.

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final VIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new VIP and assign it a number before merging it. 

Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the VIP as a whole. If a VIP is about the feature development of vision-core, and a PR of the development exists, in your VIP and your vision-core's PR you need to refer each other's github link.

When you believe your VIP is mature and ready to progress past the draft phase, you should do one of two things:

- For a Standards Track VIP of type Core, ask to have your issue added to the agenda of an upcoming All Core Devs meeting, where it can be discussed for inclusion in a future hard fork. If implementers agree to include it, the VIP editors will update the state of your VIP to 'Accepted'. 

- For all other VIPs, open a PR changing the state of your VIP to 'Final'. An editor will review your draft and ask if anyone objects to its being finalized. If the editor decides there is no rough consensus, they may close the PR and request you fix the issues in the draft before trying again.
